Selenium WebDriver
========

Hello All. The github is setup to organize and showcase all of the code I have worked on. 

Constructive criticism goes a long way and is welcome.

Crash Course on Automation/Scripting - What do I understand?

Understanding My Work Environment

  - Intellij
  - Maven
  - Junit
  - Selenium WebDriver

I am constantly learning and re-evaluating my understanding and usage of Java. It is a difficult task with nothing but the internet, but I can make it happen.

I can prove that I have a very thorough and basic understanding of all of these points. Everything in my tests I understand based on the usage I have achieved.

Where next?
